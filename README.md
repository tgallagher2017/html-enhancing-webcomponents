# html-enhancing-webcomponents
WebComponents that enhance HTML instead of build HTML providing greater control of the HTML and CSS. Using Typescript and sometimes LitElement to build the components which can wrap existing HTML to enhance their functionality. A good way to separate the HTML developer from the Javascript developer.
